# Squad Handbook

The Recap Time Squad Handbook is the central repository for how we run the organization.
As an open-source organization/company, the handbook is open to the world, and we welcome feedback and patches.

Most of the handbook written here are based off and inspired by [GitLab Team Handbook](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook), with major modifications to adapt to our needs.

For internal version of the handbook, go to [our internal wiki](https://internal.squad.lorebooks.eu.org/handbook) and sign in with your [Internal SSO account](./company/internal-sso.md).
