# Archiving a open-source project

## Instructions for maintainers

Update the README to add this notice at top using the following template. If any community forks exist to take
over the main project, please also mention it there.

```markdown
**NOTE**: _This repository is no longer supported or updated by Recap Time Squad. If you wish to continue to develop
this code yourself, we recommend you fork it._
```

If you're not a maintainer yourself, please send your changes as a patch and wait for maintainer or admin response.
If you have write permission to the main branch and the notice lapse after some days (14 days to be safe by default),
go ahead and apply the patch and notify the admins.

## Instructions for admins

Once the instructions above are accomplished, TBD.
